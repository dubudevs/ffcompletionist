Only the most savage of beasts are invited to this banquet─you'll need fangs of steel and an endless thirst for blood! Wait not for the tolling of the culling bell! Devour your rivals, take their hides for trophies, and build a hunter's throne from their bones!\r\n\r\n※Match results will affect solo PvP rating.\r\n※Players with comparable solo PvP ratings will be matched with one another and sorted into teams with relatively equal average ratings.",
