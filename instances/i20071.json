Yet as resolutely as your foe believes in his cause, so too do you believe in yours, and thus Light and Darkness must collide. Invoking the ancient magick imbued with the memories of Azem, the forgotten final member of the Convocation of Fourteen, you summon the stars to your side and prepare to face your foe in a battle to steer the very course of the world.",
