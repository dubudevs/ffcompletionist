Though it seems improbable that the warmachina could turn against its creators, a letter left by Allie reveals her intention to commandeer the Weapon and rescue her brother Alfonse from the imperials. Together with Gaius and Cid, you formulate a strategy not to destroy, but to capture the rampaging machine before any harm can come to its pilot.",
