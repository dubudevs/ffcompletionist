But while the white tiger, Byakko, has been restored to his senses, the radiant Suzaku is on the verge of succumbing to the aramitama. For centuries she has mourned the fallen Tenzen, and in her boundless grief struggled to accept his loss. What is more, her ascendant aramitama now clouds her mind and drives her to reject those who would offer her comfort. As before, there is but one way Suzaku can be brought back from the brink of madnessâ”€for the sake of the Ruby Sea and those who call her home, you and your comrades must quell the rage within the auspice's soul.",
