Some have prospered more than others in the abattoir gloom; the hydra reposes fat and malignant, an apt pupil for your yet unfinished relic. Seek out this foul orphan of the Calamity, and let the bards sing of it.\r\n\r\n※You cannot change weapons once bound by duty. Please ensure that you have equipped your unfinished relic weapon if you are undertaking this trial in order to complete the quest “A Relic Reborn.”",
