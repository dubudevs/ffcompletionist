Should the mighty serpent be allowed to unleash a tidal wave, the entire city of Limsa Lominsa will be swept into the sea. Faced with watery oblivion, the leaders of the Maelstrom have conceived a desperate plan: by lashing together two warships and filling their holds with corrupted crystals, they hope to pierce the Lord of the Whorl's defenses and give a chosen few the chance to dispatch the primal with courage and steel. The <Emphasis>Whorleater</Emphasis> sits in the bay with her towing vessel, the <Emphasis>Triumph</Emphasis>, awaiting but the command to cast off.",
