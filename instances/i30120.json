However, Themis and Erichthonios succeed in convincing the chief keyward to allow you a chance to prove the worth of another way. You are tasked with interring Hegemone, the keyward of Abyssos and a master of creation magicks in her own right. Succeed in this, and you may continue your journey into the facility's deeper circles. Fail, and Pandæmonium─along with its warders and creations─shall be reduced to nothing.",
