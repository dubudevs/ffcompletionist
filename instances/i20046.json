Unfortunately, for reasons beyond your knowing, two of the sacred treasures stored in the isle's vault “reacted” to the presence of the Yasakani–no–Magatama, summoning forth from the aether the great kami Susano─a primal by another name. How fortunate that you had the wisdom and foresight to invite several of your fellow adventurers on this journey to the Far East, and how kind they were to agree to help you torment the Red Kojin, for no single warrior, no matter how blessed or powerful, could ever hope to slay a primal on <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> own, despite what some wandering minstrels would have you believe.",
