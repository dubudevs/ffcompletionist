Put the strength of your bond to the test in two light-hearted trials, the maze-romping “Till Mog Do Us Part” and the card-flipping “Cards Beat as One.” Is your relationship destined for bliss? Or is it doomed to wither like a bad kupo nut? Register for the ceremony now and find out, kupo!\r\n\r\n※ The organizers accept no responsibility for relationship difficulties that may result.",
